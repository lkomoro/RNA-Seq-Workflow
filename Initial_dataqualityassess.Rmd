*work in progress to be filled in last since this often done already by sequencing centers*

-looking at report typically sent from sequencing center for coverage, evenness, etc.
-checking demultiplexed correctly (via matching indexes)
-check if reads that didn't pass quality filter are removed (varies by genome center)-this is short command line grep of ":Y" in fastq file
-other checks transfer from notes


####The nest step in the workflow is [file concatenation][1] (if needed, otherwise can skip to [evaluation of data quality][2])
