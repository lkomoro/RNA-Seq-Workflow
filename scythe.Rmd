#Adapter trimming with scythe

Adapters bind both the 5’ and 3’ ends of genomic DNA fragments in the sequencing library, so because they are not part of the genome any adapter contamination must be removed prior to the alignment steps. If the RNA-seq method used resulted in very short fragments, the 3’ end of the sequence can be read through to the 3’ adapter. This read through can happen at a variable position, which would prevent the sequence from aligning properly because the adapter would not correspond to the bases at the 3’ end of the reference sequence. The program scythe will trim the adapters off of the 3’ end. Scythe can be downloaded [here][1].

There are several options with the program scythe that will have to be defined. They are:
- q tells scythe it's quality encoding; the default is Sanger
- n is a minimum match length argument;  the default is 5
- M is a filter that tells the program to keep sequences less than or equal to this length; the default is 35
- o it the outputted trimmed sequences file; the default is stdout; your input file comes after this
- a is the path for your adapter file

The following shell script will adapter trim your .fastq files with scythe:

```
#!/bin/bash
#module load scythe/c128b19

for file in *.fastq

do

echo $file

sample=`echo $file | cut -f1 -d "_"`

echo $sample

scythe -M 30 \
-a /home/path_to_your_adapter/my.adapter.fasta \
-q sanger -n 0 \
-o "$sample"_R1_at.fastq \
"$sample"_R1.fastq \
> "$sample"_R1_scythe.stdout \
2> "$sample"_R1_scythe.stats.txt &

scythe -M 30 \
-a /home/path_to_your_adapter/my.adapter.fasta \
-q sanger -n 0 \
-o "$sample"_R2_at.fastq \
"$sample"_R2.fastq \
> "$sample"_R2_scythe.stdout \
2> "$sample"_R2_scythe.stats.txt

done

```
Let's take a closer look at what each part of this script is doing.

The next step in the workflow is to perform adaptive trimming with [sickle][2].
